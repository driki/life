A fine mist of pink and purple sparkles exploded around the giant robots head as Ella landed her foot against his face with a powerful 'hiiiiya' kick. Dazed from the kick the robot stumbled and in that moment Harper leapt from a high roof top tucked into a tight ball and slammed into the back of the giant metallic beast. The robot teetered back and forth from the force of Harper's jump and came crashing down, face first into the street before them.

Harper ran over to Ella, the both starred at the giant monster and they gave each other a high five. Their high five was special and it was their signature move -- up high, down low in the middle, cut the pickle and then most importantly the tickle-tickle, where they tickled each other so they could both laugh after such hard work. Ella and Harper always did this move when the defeated a super monster.

If you haven't figured it out by now, Ella and Harper are super heroes, but because Harper is three years old she calls them 'Stuper Heros'. Ella, who is 7 laughs every time Harper says that. Ella and Harper are sisters and together they battle monsters, giant robots and alien creatures with the help of the Ministry of Science. A super cool organization that not only helps solve scientific problems, but they also provide Ella and Harper with special tools that they might need to defeat villains.

Ella and Harper's parents don't know about their secret identities, they've almost been caught a few times, but they are pretty tricky and cautious. Their parents sometimes wonder why they have been gone for a while and come back all dirty and sweaty but usually Ella comes up with a great explanation for their hair being all matted down and dirt under their fingernails.

A few days after defeating the giant robot Ella got an email from the Ministry of Science. The email was from Professor Jane, she was kind of crazy, not really crazy, just her hair was always wild and out of place, sticking out in a bunch of different directions. She was tall and kind of goofy but really funny and also very, very smart. The email read:

  Dear Ella and Harper,

	Nice work defeating the giant robot. We've learned so much already from taking him apart. Our ocean sensors have picked up a disturbance in the Pacific Ocean. We're getting readings that we don't really understand, but indicate that there is likely a monster hiding out there. We've tracked it's movements and it's heading to the Hawaiian islands.

	Can you help us?

	Thanks,
	Professor Jane

Ella and Harper looked at each other, smiled and nodded. YES! Another adventure!
