# Bent

Three times I saw him try to get back up and I did nothing. The cat was clearly in pain, it's rear left leg bent at a horribly awkward angle, blood matted his fur and his low guttural howl pierced an otherwise nearly silent afternoon. Why I was able to watch rather than immediately help this animal was something that I would only reflect on with distance from the situation. In that moment though I was only fascinated with the struggle. 

I heard the cat long before I saw it, this blind corner is tight, the stretch of road beyond hidden from view. The nearly desolate logging road always made me uncomfortable. It was infrequent that a truck would speed by, but those that did bombed by at such speed as to cause a dust storm on dry days that often resulted in me bending over in a coughing fit.

This stretch was particularly frightening. I ran the route twice each week and each time I approached the tight bend I would wonder if an errant, erratic speeding truck would take me out. Would the driver stop on this isolated stretch of road to attend to me or would they in abject horror or a drunken stupor speed off, leaving me like the animal before me, suffering from my imagined fate.

Maybe it was a stray, it had no collar, yet the cat did not look like the shabby, feral barn cats that I had seen hanging around horse hobbles when I was a kid. I starred down at the dusty ground on this isolated 10 mile stretch, the screaming cat rolling around nearly at the mid-point of my run. I carry no phone on this run, not that it would matter, there not being cell service even if I were to have one.

I bent down on a knee as one would tie their shoe, closely watching the labored breath of the cat. His chest rising shallowly. I touched the matted fur and felt the sticky warmth of blood mixed with the tiny pebbles and dirt from the road. Without thought I reached down, put both my hands on the cat, feeling the restricted breathing. I picked him up, gathered him in my arms and ran.

I call him Bent.
