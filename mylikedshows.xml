      <title>&lt;p&gt;Ellen Page is every bit as brilliant and cool as you've heard. The Oscar-nominated actress hangs out with Anna and Sim in this week's Episode, discussing Ellen's experience eating dog food, Anna's knowledge of Canadian provinces, and why it's Anna's dream to become a flight attendant. Ellen also talks about her new docu-series, GAYCATION, which literally moved Anna to tears. And you won't want to miss this week's calls! First, the gang offers unqualified advice to a woman who still has intense feelings for her first love...with whom she happens to work...even though she's engaged to another man and just had a child with him! They also help a male caller decide whether to bring a date to a wedding where he'll see his longtime crush with her new boyfriend! And you won't want to miss what Anna blurted out at a McDonald's outing with Chris! This episode is a MUST listen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credits:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Even the best Puzzle Masters make an occasional mistake. But Martin Gardner and Will Shortz probably never had one of their errors exposed as dramatically (and hilariously) as Ray's recent mango tree Puzzler. Find out how it plays out, this week on the Best of Car Talk. Elsewhere, Robert's Mercedes dealer gave him a blanket and pen to apologize for over-filling his engine with oil. Should Robert have asked them to wrap a new engine in that blanket? Also, Carey thinks her husband's downshifting advice may be responsible for her Expedition's clunk, but the noise may have more to do with the 9,000 pounds of barbecue equipment Carey is hauling around; and, a tale of what happens when overly-encumbered by the thought process engineers try to paint an apartment. All this and more, this week on The Best of Car Talk.</title>

      <title>The middle of the 20th Century was a golden age for road travel in the United States. Cars had become cheap and spacious enough to carry families comfortably for hundreds of miles. The Interstate Highway System had started to connect the country’s smaller roads in a vast nationwide network. That freedom and mobility, however, was not equally available to everyone.

Some African-American tourists would drive all night instead of trying to find lodging in an unfamiliar and possibly dangerous town. They would pack picnics so they could avoid stopping at restaurants that might refuse to serve them.

But in 1936, a man named Victor Hugo Green started a travel guide to make life on the road easier and safer for black motorists.

      <title>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode of “Unqualified,” the gang welcomes a long-time FRIEND: Lisa Kudrow!  Listen in as Anna and Lisa reminisce about Anna’s guest-starring role on the final season of FRIENDS.  Then, in the most off-the-wall “Rapid Fire” series yet, Anna and Lisa deliberate about whether an Emmy or a SAG Award trophy is the deadlier weapon.  Anna, Sim, and Lisa also talk to a woman who wants to know whether she should remain friends with a man for whom she has feelings, or whether it is time to move on.  And our last caller made Anna giddy with excitement—tune in to find out why! &lt;/p&gt;
