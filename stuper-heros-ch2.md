Ella and Harper had just received an email from Professor Jane, the crazy scientist that helped them from the Ministry of Science. She asked for their help tracking a very large monster in the Pacific Ocean.

Now, how would Ella and little Harper get all the way from Massachusetts to the the Hawaiian Islands? Well, of course Ella would email her best friend who had the super power of flying. Alex was Ella's best friend and classmate in 2nd grade and the two of them went on many adventures together as part of the Lowell League, sort of like the Justice League but for elementary school kids. Ella reached out to Alex to see if she could help on this mission, of course Alex said "Yes!". Duh.

So, Alex flew over to Ella and Harper's house, knocked on the window gently and Ella let her in. Alex floated through the window as Harper shut the bedroom door. The three of them whispered about the mission, "What kind of monster do you think it is?" asked Alex. "Must be a big one" said Ella, "otherwise the Ministry wouldn't have called us in to help." Harper nodded her head in agreement with her big sister.

"So how are we going to sneak away?" asked Alex. Ella was a problem solver, she always had a plan to fix complicated and challenging problems. It was after dinner, so the three super hero kids filled the bunk beds with stuffed animals and blankets, placing a funny hat on the pillow to hide where their heads would be. "Mom! Dad! Harper and I are going to put ourselves to bed, is that OK with you?" Kids who wanted to put themselves to bed! What parent would say no to that? "SURE!" their parents yelled from the living room. "Just make sure you use the potty before bed." "We will." Ella yelled.

Yes! They were free to fly with super speed across the country and the ocean to visit Hawaii and find this super monster. Ella closed the window as Alex grabbed her two friends and floated high into the sky. As they cleared the trees and telephone poles she looked at her two buddies and asked? "Ready to fly?!". As Harper and Ella both mouthed yes, the air rushed past them, the hair from all three girls whipping around their heads as they screamed across the country.
