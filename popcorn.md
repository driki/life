# Popcorn

He's holding a bag of popcorn in one hand, the other absently dips in grabbing a handful of popped kernels, jamming them into his mouth, the shards and remnants of previous attempts to eat smear his lower lip. Looking closely, yellow tinted  fluffed corn occupies the space between his teeth, and as he laughs about a private, internal joke, a bit flies out of his mouth and lands on the train floor.

His hair is matted, not foul, but it is clear that he is in need of a shower, likely it has been a few days. Because the train is crowded, a woman sits next to him, intently staring at her phone, ear buds in place and oblivious to the man next to her.

The sequel of the train wheels grinding around a corner indicate that we're pulling into a station. The woman, a girl really, looks up briefly, shuffles and gathers her belongings, readying herself to exit the train. The train sways as it slows, and she grabs the pole with her free hand, steadying herself as she stands, heading toward the door that will open. She exits with the crowd.

The man, who was inwardly focused, makes eye contact with me, stares in the direction of the sliding door, stands with conviction, but then looks at me with pleading eyes. This look is fleeting, his eyes shift and become both wild and focused. I notice that he's taller and much larger than his frame suggested when sitting, yet exits the train deftly and as I watch him walk down the platform the doors close.
