A new key.

My newly milled key has a bright shine to the metal and sharp edges that my old key does not. When I rub my fingers over the length of this new key, the bumps and ridges, while prickly, stimulate new and unexpected sensations. Holding the key in my hands, sliding my index finger over the ridges, I note that the grooves running it's length are clean and without the sludgy build up or grime of my old key. But I fumble and struggle when putting my new key into the lock, a lack of practice certainly the cause. The new key also results in jarring, uncomfortable sounds as metal grinds into an unfamiliar lock.

The newness of this key is striking when compared to my old one.

Years of pocket lint, handling and use have smoothed the ridges of my old key. The gunk of life coats the nooks and crannies, dulling the once bright metallic sheen. But a wave of comfort rolls over me when my thumb slides up and down the old key, the knowledge that this key glides into the lock with ease, that the motions are nearly automatic and that the sound when the lock opens is pleasing.

The gunk of life will coat this new key, the bumps and harsh edges will soften with each use and become familiar to my fingers. The metallic sounds will become pleasing and I will not fumble to open the door.

I will miss my old key, but my new key will become my old key.
